[Plans](https://github.com/Areskiko/ababot/projects/1)

> [docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/areskiko/ababot)

* If you use the Dockerfile add the flags -i and -t, so that you may provide a token manually. If you use a volume you won't have to do this the next time you spin up the container.
* Docker-compose file adds the volume automatically and will remember the token you used next time you run it.
